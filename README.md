# Chatmapper XML to CSV export
A tiny program I use to export the "Hello, My Name Is Nobody" prototype dialogue files from Chatmapper to CSV in order to use in Unreal Engine 4. The program also execute some validations to the dialogue nodes (for example nodes without a target node) before export the data.
